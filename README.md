# Login and Registration Form
This project provides a simple, client-side login and registration form with password validation, built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a great starting point for understanding fundamental web development concepts, including form handling, styling, and basic JavaScript validation.

## Features
Login Form: Users can enter a username and password to "log in" (client-side validation only).

Registration Form: New users can register by providing a username and password.

##### Password Validation:

Minimum length requirement.

Requires at least one uppercase letter.

Requires at least one lowercase letter.

Requires at least one number.

Requires at least one special character.

Toggle Forms: Easily switch between the login and registration views.

Client-Side Only: All validation and "authentication" logic is handled directly in the browser using JavaScript. No backend server is involved.

## Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure and content of the web pages.

CSS3: For styling and layout, making the forms visually appealing and responsive.

JavaScript: For all interactive elements, form handling, and password validation
